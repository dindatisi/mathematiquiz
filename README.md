# mathematiquiz
Simple 2-player mathematics battle using Arduino.

This was my final project in II3231 Human-Computer Interface Interaction class in Bandung Institute of Technology. I have previously made the code available [here](https://dindatc.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/ii3231-final-project-mathematiquiz/). The code comments were written in Bahasa.

## Installation
### One Player Game
This can be run
You'll need Arduino, LCD display, Keypad, LED, restistor, and radio nRF24L01. Make sure you connect them according to this design:

Connect the arduino to your computer and run the code in Arduino IDE

### Two-Player Game
You'll need two of each component required to run one player game. In addition, you have to copy the code and paste to another file with some phrasing adjustment (because it's now P1 and P2). Then deploy the codes to each arduino.
